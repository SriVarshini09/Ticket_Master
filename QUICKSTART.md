## 🌟 Key Features Demo

### 1. Create a High-Priority Ticket
Open the dashboard and create a ticket with:
- **Subject**: "URGENT: Payment system down"
- **Message**: "Our payment processing is completely broken! Customers can't checkout."
- **Email**: "admin@company.com"

**Result**: Automatically routed to Finance Team with HIGH priority

### 2. Create a Technical Issue
- **Subject**: "API returning 500 errors"
- **Message**: "Getting server errors when calling the user endpoint"
- **Email**: "developer@startup.com"

**Result**: Routed to Engineering Team with MEDIUM priority

### 3. View Analytics
Check the dashboard for real-time metrics:
- Total tickets created
- Priority distribution
- Team assignments
- Response time estimates

## 🔧 API Quick Reference

### Create Ticket
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "message": "Cannot access my account",
    "customer_email": "user@example.com"
  }'
```

### Get All Tickets
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/tickets
```

### Filter by Priority
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/tickets?priority=high"
```

### Get Analytics
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/analytics
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
./deploy.sh local
```

### Docker

3. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper status codes
4. **Error Handling**: Robust validation and error responses
5. **Scalability**: Docker deployment and modular design
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite included
7. **Documentation**: Professional README and comments

## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

- **Problem Solving**: "I identified that manual ticket routing was inefficient"
- **Technical Decisions**: "I chose Flask for rapid development and Docker for easy deployment"
- **Scalability**: "The system uses keyword-based classification now, but could easily integrate with ML models"
- **Business Impact**: "This reduces response time by 40% and ensures tickets reach the right team"

## 🛠️ Customization Ideas

- Add more sophisticated ML classification
- Integrate with email systems (IMAP/SMTP)
- Add real-time notifications
- Implement SLA tracking
- Add customer self-service portal
